🧾 Description
</h1>

🤔 **Are you annoyed of having the text of your game in a certain language?**

🔎 **Do you want to change the text language of your game without changing the audio** *(Voiceline...)* **language?**

> *This script was made to be able to change the language of VALORANT separately, i.e., change the text language without changing the voice language!
Simply by using a batch script, change the text language of the game, whether it be UI/Map/Pings texts without changing agents voicelines/GOTV's voice you want to have!*
