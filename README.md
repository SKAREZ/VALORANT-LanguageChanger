Description

🤔 **Are you tired of having the voicelines or the text of your game in a certain language?**

🔎 **Do you want to change the text language of your game without changing the voice language or vice versa?**

> *This script was made to be able to change the language of VALORANT separately, i.e., change the text language without changing the voice language, or vice versa.
Simply by using a bash script, change the language of the game, whether it be UI/Map/Pings texts or agents voicelines/GOTV's voice!*

⚠ If you have troubles when using this script, ask me for help on [Discord](https://discord.gg/sS7X8cPt62), or read the FAQ

  R: **If you have difficulties to run the script, contact me on Discord, I will help you fast as I can!**


- ### Q: The script is working, but my VALORANT had no changes on texts/voicelines language or even crashed!
  R: **If the script was working, but VALORANT had no changes or crashed at the start, you need to watch theses things:**
*First, verifiy that your game is in English by default, by changing the language via Riot Client in the options of the client.*
*Also, verifiy while launching the script, that your VALORANT installation game path is correct!*
*(By default it's this path: "X:/Riot Games/VALORANT/live", and don't forget to change the "X" to your actual hard-drive letter, like "C" or "E" for exemple.)*
*Be carefull to have your game up to date before injecting the languages files, and also having your Riot Client opened!*
*Or last option, the script is obsolete, and to know if it's the script, you can go here to check the script update status: https://bit.ly/3bnV4DH or https://bit.ly/3xNxK9R*
