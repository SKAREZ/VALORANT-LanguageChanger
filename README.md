Description

🤔 **Are you annoyed of having the text of your game in a certain language?**

🔎 **Do you want to change the text language of your game without changing the audio** *(Voiceline...)* **language?**

> *This script was made to be able to change the language of VALORANT separately, i.e., change the text language without changing the voice language!
Simply by using a bash script, change the text language of the game, whether it be UI/Map/Pings texts without changing agents voicelines/GOTV's voice you want to have!*

⚠ If you have troubles when using this script, ask me for help on [Discord](https://discord.gg/sS7X8cPt62), ask me for help here, read the FAQ or see the "Help" page in the script!

- ### 💬 Q: The script is working, but my VALORANT had no changes on texts language or even crashed!
  ➡ R: **If the script was working, but VALORANT had no changes or crashed at the start, you need to watch theses things:**
  #### First, verifiy that your game is in English by default, by changing the language via Riot Client in the options of the client.
  #### Also, verifiy while launching the script, that your VALORANT installation game path is correct! *(By default it's this path: "X:/Riot Games/VALORANT/live", and don't forget to change the "X" to your actual hard-drive letter, like "C" or "E" for exemple.)*
  #### Be carefull to have your game up to date before injecting the language files, and also having your Riot Client opened!
  #### Or last option, the script is obsolete, and to know if it's the script, you can go here to check the script update status: **https://bit.ly/3bnV4DH** or **https://bit.ly/3xNxK9R**
